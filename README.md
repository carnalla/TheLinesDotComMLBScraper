# TheLinesDotComMLBScraper
This code pulls moneyline odds from DraftKings and FanDuel for all Major League Baseball games when run. 

I wanted to build a base program for comparing odds across betting sites. Post-scraping processing is the next step. This should serve as a nice base item for anyone who struggled as much as I did finding out how to scrape dynamically-updated odds from these types of sites. 

I would also like to acknowledge two main sources without whom - after many of my own failures - provided the insight required to get this done.
